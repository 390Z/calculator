# calculator

A simple calculator created with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.  Design/logic inspired by Google's calculator and Apple's iPhone calculator.

**This is still a work-in-progress:**

  - Decimal input logic fails after deleting an operator or parenthesis
  - Missing keyboard support
  - Formula trails off the calculator's screen if it exceeds the screen's width
  - Certainly could be done better/cleaner; I will update this project as I become more proficient
